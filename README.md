The system can control the on/off status of the lights based on light intensity levels (lumens) or the presence of vehicles and pedestrians. 
The goal is to enhance energy efficiency and improve road safety. 
This system utilizes a comparator function to control the lighting. 

#Mode Selection: Set the selector switch to the “Normal” or “Power Saving” position to select the desired mode.

#Normal Mode:
Light Measurement: The light sensor measures the surrounding brightness level in real-time.
Lumen Level: The light level is measured in lumens.
Light Adjustment:
If the lumen is less than 30: All 4 lights turn On.
If the lumen is between 31-60: 2 lights turn On.
If the lumen is between 61-120: 1 light turns On.

#Power Saving Mode:
Sensor Activation: The lights are activated by a PIR sensor that detects vehicle or pedestrian movement.
Individual Sensors: Each light (total of 4 lights) has its own motion/PIR sensor.
On-Demand Lighting: The lights only turn on when the sensor detects movement.
